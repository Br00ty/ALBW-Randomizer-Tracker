- Author: LemonKong
- Version: 0.0.1
    - Initial Beta version

## Features

- **Dungeon Tracker:** Maps for every dungeon, with full logic tracking! Check out the locations and accessibility of
  chests, small keys, heart containers, and dungeon rewards at a glance. A multi-tabbed, flexible layout is provided,
  one that can neatly accommodate even Hera's massive thirteen floors and provide quick and ease switching between maps.


- **Maiamai Map**: Click the Maiamai Map icon to be shown all Maiamai currently in logic! All 100 Maiamai are present,
  displayed as smaller squares than normal checks. The Maiamai Map icon can be toggled on/off to show/hide the Maiamai
  as desired.
    - NOTE: Bombs are required to open Mother Maiamai's Cave, meaning they are required to obtain/see every single
      Maiamai.


- **High Definition Overworld Maps:** 2048x2048 maps supplied for tracking the Hyrule and Lorule Overworlds in great
  detail! Two options are provided to give you more viewing control:
    - The "Side-by-Side" view shows Hyrule and Lorule together so you can see everything at once.
    - The "Zoomed" view provides a close-up look at both maps, making it easier to focus on a specific area.


- **A Link to the Past-Inspired Compact Menu Layout**: Given this is the sequel to one of the most famous games to
  receive a randomizer, I really wanted this tracker to pay homage to ALttP with its item layout. The layout tries to
  copy the Start Menu of ALttP using its sequel's items, with minimal substitutions, while also making room for this
  game's new additions. The entire layout is kept compact, with all items fitting neatly inside a 6x8 grid.


- **Options Menu**: The tracker supports Standard + Open modes, but will default to the popular Open Mode settings. You can tweak these as you like in the Options Menu; presets are a planned feature for a future update. Also, several difficult tricks are not considered in logic by default, but can be enabled from this same menu.


- **Item-Only Mode:** Disable maps and show only the compact item tracker.
    - Broadcast Mode will similarly show only the compact item tracker.


- **Pinned Locations**: Pin any location to the side bar for later! Scroll bar support added for those who like to pin all the things.


- **Capture Item Support**: Take notes! The tracker supports recording the contents of all dungeon chests and
  freestanding items. These may be set to many of the standard items on the tracker, as well as several "trash" items (
  rupees, heart pieces, monster guts, etc.).
    - Integrates with EmoTracker's Global Notes system

## FAQ

- **Why did you make this?**
    - Why does anyone make anything?
    

- **Why all the Triforces?**
    - The black Lorulean Triforce (I like to call it the "Loforce") represents gaining access to Lorule, and is the
      prize for defeating Yuga 2 in Hyrule Castle. It is a prerequisite for every single check in Lorule, along with
      Merge.
    - The Triforce of Courage is largely decorative; you can ignore it, and the tracker will work just fine. It's there
      for those who want to record when they collect it, or not record it to signify it's been skipped. Clicking it a
      second time will upgrade it to the full Triforce, to show that the game has been completed.
        - Lorule Castle's logic will accept the Triforce of Courage in place of the seven Sages, if for some reason you
          don't feel like clicking them all.


- **What's the Bomb Flower for?**
    - Purchase the Big Bomb Flower at the Bomb Flower Store to unlock this. The Bomb Flower can be used to blow up huge
      rocks blocking several other checks, and in a pinch it can be used in place of the usual bombs to blast open the
      Vacant House.


- **What's the blonde haired guy for?**
    - That's the Shady Guy, you run into him when first approaching Zora's Domain. That short cutscene is a trigger that
      activates two checks in Kakariko Village: one for buying the item in the Smooth Gem Slot from the Street Merchant,
      and one for sneaking up on the Shady Guy himself to get an item.


- **What's the purple bunny sign for?**
    - The Ravio Sign represents a trigger you can activate by watching a short cutscene near Eastern Palace. This
      trigger will cause Ravio to give you the item in the Bow slot for free the next time you enter his shop. This
      trigger is superseded by the triggers that unlock Ravio's full shop, and so activating any of them will "upgrade"
      the Sign on the tracker to Ravio, indicating the shop is fully open.


- **Why isn't the trigger for Ravio's Signs available?**
    - On Standard Mode, the signs won't appear until you go through the game's prologue story triggers. After completing the Sanctuary, you need to go to Zelda to get the Special Charm, and then Sahasrahla's House to have him mark your map with an X.
      - There are no checks on the map for Special Charm/Sahasrahla. If this becomes a problem or creates confusion, I will add them, but I didn't think they were necessary.


- **What's the trigger to activate Hyrule Hotfoot?**
    - Any of the Irene triggers.
    

- **What's the star next to the Master Sword?**
    - That's the Great Spin you uncultured swine.


- **I can't see any Maiamai?**
    - In addition to clicking the golden Maiamai Map icon, you must also have Bombs to see any Maiamai. This is because
      Bombs are needed to open Mother Maiamai's Cave, and so are required for every single Maiamai.


- **There are too many Maiamai!**
    - Click the Maiamai Map icon again to hide all the Maiamai checks.


- **You labelled the 2F in Swamp and 6F in Lorule Castle incorrectly!!**
    - Are you sure?


- **I found a problem with the logic!**
    - Probably. There's an awful lot of combinations, I probably missed at least a few. Please send me a polite message
      explaining the behavior you're seeing, with a screenshot (if possible) should the logic be particularly complex.
